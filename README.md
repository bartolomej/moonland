# MoonLand

MoonLand queries social media platforms to provide social sentiment analytics for various crypto coins.

## 👋 Get started

1. You need to install Docker & docker-compose in order to run this app with Docker. 
See: [Docker installation instructions](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

2. Add environment variables
Create `.env` file in project root, with environment variables defined in `.env.example`

3. Once you have installed and setup docker, run:
    ```shell
   # run development configuration
    docker-compose up -d
   
   # run production configuration
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
    ```
   
   Your local app should now be up and running on http://localhost:5000 🥳.

## 🏛 Architecture

MoonLand is based on a simple microservice architecture, with 2 services:
- `analytics` is concerned with data aggregation and analysis
- `gateway` deals with user management and authentication (also acts as a proxy)
