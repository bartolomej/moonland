## üëã Get started

1. You need to install Docker & docker-compose in order to run this app with Docker. 
See: [Docker installation instructions](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

2. Add environment variables
Create `.env` file in project root, with environment variables defined in `.env.example`

3. Once you have installed and setup docker, run:
    ```shell
   # run development configuration
    docker-compose up -d
   
   # run production configuration
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up

   Your local app should now be up and running on http://localhost:5000 ü•≥.

## üèõ Architecture

Moonland data model is designed with extensibility in mind. We could easily extend the platform to support multiple data sources (aka. "social platforms"), etc.

In terms of application architecture, Moonland is based on a simple microservice architecture, with 2 services:
- `analytics` is concerned with data aggregation and analysis
- `gateway` deals with user management and authentication (also acts as a proxy)
